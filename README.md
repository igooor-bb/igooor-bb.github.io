Repository of the personal blog.

## A few words about website

The website is built on the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) engine. I have long wanted to make a website to publish thoughts related to my field, but I could not decide on the design and other details for a long time. Finally, I made the theme by my own, inspired by and using some of the things from [Whiteglass](https://github.com/yous/whiteglass) and [Klis√©](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise). Be sure to check them out, I think they are very beautiful.
