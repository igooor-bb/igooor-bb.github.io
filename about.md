### Brief biography 👨🏻‍💻

```swift
func sayHello() {
  print("Hello there!")
}
```

Hello, my name is Igor, and I consider myself an experienced iOS developer. Now I live in Innopolis, Russia and study at the university there.

I've had a lot of practice working with UIKit and I respect it, but I see the future in the declarative principles of SwiftUI and lately I've been writing production projects in it.

There are many frameworks and technologies that I have had the opportunity to use for various tasks. By the way, lately I've been focusing on CoreImage, because at the company where I work we make video editors.

I like to write neat code, although it's not always possible. Working with legacy for a long time has hardened me 😅

And actually, I speak in Swift.

### A few words about website 🦋

The website is built on the [Jekyll][jekyll] engine. I have long wanted to make a website to publish thoughts related to my field, but I could not decide on the design and other details for a long time. Finally, I made the theme by my own, inspired by and using some of the things from [Whiteglass][whiteglass] and [Klisé][klise]. Be sure to check them out, I think they are very beautiful.
